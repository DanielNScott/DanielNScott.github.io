      <h1 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h1>
<p>Broadly, I’m interested in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Formal and computational properties of neural systems</li>
  <li>Their relationships with psychiatry and neuro-typicality.</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular I research:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Representation in neural networks with different degrees of biological abstraction</li>
  <li>Network properties of cortico-basal ganglia loops and their relation to impulsivity and compulsivity</li>
</ul>

<p>Studying neural computation in these guises allows me to bring formal topics I find deeply interesting in their own right (such as statistics, optimization, and geometry) together with work on the biological and algorithmic aspects of human learning and decision-making. Linking these with behavior is something I find both socially important and theoretically rich, and psychiatry provides a means of doing so while simultaneously aiming to help people in the short term.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>As a community college student I discovered academics. As an undergrad at UC Berkeley I double majored in physics and math, and worked on probabilistic graphical models probing human assessments of causality. I had a foray into large scale ecosystem (i.e. climate change) modeling at Harvard, but that wasn’t really my cup of tea. My primary interest in life is solving the multi-objective optimization problem of living up to my humanist values (foremost), having fun (secondarily), and doing interesting, meaningful, reasonably remunerated work (a close third). More whimsically, I hope to live in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest with a certain scholar of English literature, cats, dogs, and a garden.</p>
