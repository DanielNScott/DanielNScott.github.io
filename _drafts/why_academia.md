[Notes: This needs a motivating question - why am I saying these things?]

A question which people sometimes ask one another, if less than may be appropriate, is "why are you an academic?" I for one have many answers to this question, and have answered differently many times I've been asked. The compendium of answers is much more interesting than any one, so I've made a list:

 - "Because I see it as a route to personal freedom"
 - "Because society is coercive"
 - "Because more meaningful work is currently inaccessible"
 - "Because more meaningful work is too poorly paid"
 - "Because more meaningful work is insecure"
 - "It was an accident"
 - "Because I was in academia yesterday"
 - "Because I love learning"
 - "Because science is used to help people sometimes"
 - "Because academics are often interesting people"
 - "Because I've noticed it makes me a better person"
 - "Because I like to try challenging things"
