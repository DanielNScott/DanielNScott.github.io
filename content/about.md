# Research interests #
I have two overlapping research questions, which could be stated as:
 - What are the formal and computational properties of neural systems?
 - How are they related to psychiatry and neuro-typicality?

These are broad formulations around which whole disciplines are being built, and it is far from clear what answering them entails. To address some small aspects of them, I have been:
 - Examining neural networks with different degrees of biological abstraction
 - Investigating impulsivity in relation to cortico-basal ganglia loops

Notably, I mean formal and computational in specialized senses here: An example of a formal question about representation is, "How is the configuration space of a trained auto-encoder constructed with biologically realistic neurons related to one constructed with the usual abstractions?" An example of a computational question about cortico-basal ganglia loops is: "How does the class of problems solvable by such loops change when you allow or increase inter-level cross talk?"

Approaching neural computation in these guises allows me to bring formal topics I find interesting in their own right (such as statistics, optimization, and geometry) together with work on the biological and algorithmic aspects of human learning and decision-making. That's the idea at any rate. Relating these to psychiatry will be valuable because there is significant human need and very little mechanistic understanding in that domain.

# My background #
I skipped (as in truancy) high school because I disliked society. I would say my criticisms remain valid but my analysis of what to do about them has changed. I soon became a community college student, then an undergrad at UC Berkeley. I double majored in physics and math, and I worked on probabilistic graphical models probing human assessments of causality. I also worked on large scale ecosystem modeling at Harvard (relevant to climate change), but disliked the associated academic/career path. I'm currently working on a PhD on neural computation.

My primary goals in life are living up to my humanist values (foremost), having fun with friends and family (secondarily), and doing interesting, meaningful, reasonably remunerated work (a close third). More whimsically, I hope to live in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest with a certain scholar of English literature, cats, dogs, and a garden.
