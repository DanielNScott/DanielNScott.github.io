# On readings, worthwhile and not #
Here are notes on a variety of non-technical things I've read since sometime around 2017, with additions from the preceding few years that also made lasting impressions.

I quote Zadie Smith who quotes Nabakov, on a practice not yet mine: "Curiously enough, one cannot read a book: one can only reread it. A good reader, a major reader, an active and creative reader is a rereader."

Someday I hope to re-read some of these. So they are (coarsely) rated:

 - 1: only as good as a random book on a worthwhile topic, i.e. not
 - 2: decent, worthwhile for the interested or patient
 - 3: recommended
 - 4: very, very good

## Science writing ##
I usually find science writing to be poor, but frequently the content is partially redeeming. How needless, this fact! My main complaints separate by category: Anthropological writing is often badly stuctured with regard to the central argument and supporting prose. Technology writing often contains reflexive adulation of the topic at hand, lacks cohesion, and is eager to participate in facile lesson mongering. Psychology writing shares some of these along with the worse qualities of self-help writing. Threes and fours below minimize these.

**Sapiens** (3) <br/>
Noah Yuval Hirari <br/>
Hirari argues cultural evolution produces systems of thinking and belief which coordinate populations' activities. Stronger cohesion and coordination increase a culture's ability to reproduce.

**Tropical Nature** (4) <br/>
Forsyth & Miyata <br/>
Tropical rainforests have many interesting things going on! This book achieves the classic evocation of wonder associated with nature writing. The authors shade into shallow ruminations on Darwinism in a sentance here or there, but this is not at all excessive.

**Superforecasting** (2) <br/>
Tetlock & Gardner <br/>
This book details research on how people make good judgements about the likelihood of different future scenarios coming to pass. The main point: Use many kinds of evidence to develop and update quantitative estimates. The book specifies further.

**Algorithms to Live By** (1) <br/>
Christian & Griffiths <br/>
Addresses many interesting subjects. They are not developed in depth.

**The Knowledge Illusion** (3) <br/>
Fernbach & Sloman <br/>
Outlines how and why we are embedded as people in communities of knowledge, discusses the illusions this creates for our senses of knowing, and looks at some of the implications of these points.

**Learn Better** (1) <br/>
Boser <br/>
Chummy, long winded, and lacking content.

**Unmaking the West** (4) <br/>
Eds. Tetlock, Lebow, Parker <br/>
This is one of the best compendiums I have ever read. Thousands of years are addressed and the foundations of topics associated with the west are examined from many angles. These include democracy, christianity, and the industrial revolution. In one exceptional essay, Kenneth Pomeranz claims the European industrial revolution arises from the confluence of high environmental degradation, demographic pressure, social proximity between artisans, gentleman scientists and industrialists, the existence of coal near the surface of Britain, and the tendancy of mines there to fill with water. Related contingencies are also discussed at length re. China.<br/>

## Writing on economics and politics ##
In my experience, economic writing doesn't often exhibit the same carelessness of prose that is frequently seen in popularizations of science. It does seem to exhibit greater variation in the quality and nature of its arguments and evidence. Many of the books below address economics as if explanations of longer term or macro-economic phenomena were comparable to established explanations in other scientific domains. This is false. Nonetheless, many are interesting and valuable.

**Platform Capitalism** (3)<br/>
Nick Srnicek <br/>
Much better written than *Inventing the Future*. The book elaborates how companies construct market-like forms for centralizing services (that is, platforms) with the aim of operating as necessary and ubiquitous rent-extractive infrastructure. Srnicek also outlines the conditions (low return from most financial vehicles, Fordism's disintegration, and others) which he argues produced platforms. A more concise and informative book on the topic would be difficult to write.

**The Concept of the Political** (2) <br/>
Carl Schmitt <br/>
Schmitt seems either obscurantist or muddled, in a manner reminiscent of deconstructionism. His attention to sovereignty and authority, and his manichaen thinking are interesting, although I find his prescriptions unconvincing. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a superior [text](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/#ConPolCriLib) to read on his views.

**The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics** (2)<br/>
Mark Lilla <br/>
Lilla argues for a classical liberal political analysis, plus nationalism without imperialism. His typology of anti-politics, pseudo-politics, and politics, don't appear to have construct or ecological validity, but this is minor. He shares Srnicek's view that progressive became anti-* and fail to articulate compelling narratives for the nation or the future. As a recent intellectual and cultural history of politics this book also has value, despite the presentation as a long form op-ed. The book is less even keel and informative than Lilla's others.

**The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politics** (3) <br/>
Mark Lilla <br/>

**The Shipwrecked Mind: On Political Reaction** (3) <br/>
Mark Lilla

**Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus** (2)<br/>
Douglass Rushkoff

**Postcapitalism** (2) <br/>
George Mason <br/>

**Inventing the Future** (2)<br/>
Nick Srnicek <br/>

**Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt** (3)<br/>
Chris Hedges <br/>
Did you like *Blood of the Land* by Rex Weyler? This is sociological non-fiction on the conditions and histories of the less fortunate in the United States. The illustrated format is compelling, and the first person auto-biographical narration creates intimacy.

**The Unwomanly Face of War** (4) <br/>
Svetlana Alexiavich <br/>
This book has radically altered my understanding of the USSR, its culture and gender relations, and the the impact of World War II in the region.

**God and Man at Yale** (2) <br/>
William F. Buckley <br/>
Buckley fulminates against topics you would guess. The book is worthwhile in contextualizing intellectual political history and understanding the conservative intelligentsia. No great shakes.

## Fiction & Poetry ##
These have a slightly higher bar than the rest, since my partner is a professor of English literature and recommended many of them. For the sake of discriminability I can't give them all 4's, so 3's here are, in my estimation, actually very, very good too.

**The Argonauts** (3)<br/>
Maggie Nelson<br/>

**There but for the** (3)<br/>
Allie Smith<br/>

**Eros the bittersweet** (-)<br/>
Anne Carson<br/>

**The Beauty of the Husband** (4)<br/>
Anne Carson<br/>

**Hope in the dark** (3)<br/>
Rebecca Solnit<br/>

## Misc. & Cultural Commentary ##
**Against Everything** (3)<br/>
Mark Greif<br/>

**A Revolution in Mathematics** (2)<br/>
A short essay by Frank Quinn in AMS 2012 [here](http://www.personal.psu.edu/cpc16/Quinn-Revolution.pdf).

**Bright-Sided** (2)<br/>
Barbara Ehrenreich<br/>

**The Two Cultures** (-)<br/>
C.P. Snow <br/>
