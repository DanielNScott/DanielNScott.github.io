## Interests ##
I research how reinforcement-modulated spike-timing dependent plasticityÂ restructures spiking neural networks. This is an important problem because most real plasticity in the brain is likely to be either unsupervised or reinforcement-based, with the potential exception of various forms of replay. I analyze this remodeling of network structure using a combination of mathematics and simulations. The impact of learning on spike-count correlations and network information is of particular interest, because these macroscopic variables are important for population-coding.

From my perspective, the research described above is a case study in "complex systems science"; It allows me to think about neural networks from the angles of network dynamics, spin models, and applied algebraic topology, for example. A second topic area I'm interested in is the application of probabilistic graphical models to computational psychiatry. I have an ongoing project using hierarchical Bayesian models to examine the relationship between fMRI measures, task-based-behavioral data, and putative measures of trait impulsiveness.

In the near term, I would like to flesh out my basic knowledge of stochastic processes, information geometry, and thalamo-cortical biology, and to integrate these into my research on learning. I'm especially interested in "sloppy" models and model reduction in neuroscience. In the longer term, I'm interested in collaborating with social scientists in order to understand how neuroscientific theories of learning may interface with developmental and social factors to influence outcomes such as media- and scientific- literacy.

## Philosophy ##
While people vary in their approaches to science and education, I have had an abiding belief that developing broad knowledge and skill is both the more pragmatic and (for myself) enjoyable goal than early specialization. The exceptionally long human developmental trajectory, hypotheses about climate-variation induced hominid "generalist" phylogeny, the historical trend of educating children and delaying "productive" labor longer, and the high degree of uncertainty about academic job prospects are, for example, all qualitatively different considerations suggesting such a conclusion.
