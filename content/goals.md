# Notes on accomplishing goals #
Having learned a great deal from reading and talking to people about accomplishing one's goals, I contribute my two cents to the bourgeoning cottage industry below.

## Common enough points ##
The most basic advice/commentary often bears repeating, so that one might actually take it. My apologies that a few points are hackneyed and/or uncomfortable.

 - Formulate concrete, achievable goals, with time estimates.
 - Notice that accurately estimating how long new tasks will take is very hard.
 - Plan backwards from your goals.
 - "Success" is less important than improvement.
 - Nothing ventured means nothing gained.
 - Don't self-sabatoge.
 - Work hard and try to "work smart" as well.
 - Have a growth mindset.
 - Don't dwell on unavoidable difficulties.
 - Focus on actionable things.
 - Hedge your bets.

## Less ritualized verbiage ##
These are additional, specific things I find one ought to keep in mind.

 - Failing at something is less diagnostic than it often seems.
 - Don't be lazy about concepts. Perform thought experiments when you encounter new ones.
 - Solid understanding is cumulative but requires cultivating strong self-directed skepticism.
 - Breadth-depth trade-offs should be engineered when possible.
 - One enters regimes of diminishing return very quickly. Hence, breadth is cheaper than it appears.
 - Determine your actual values, since goals without values are silly.
 - Continue to scrutinize said values.
 - Be aware of values implicit in your environments.
 - Take good care of your mental health, and especially sleep.
 - Within reason, discount others' judgements when they demonstrably conflict with your values.
 - Work to understand others' judgements, from the frames in which they're being made.
 - Don't believe everything you think.
 - Determine edge-cases and domains of validity for assertions you make or encounter.
 - Determine what the originater of such assertions believes them mean.
 - Think of problems in both simplified and generalized forms.
 - Imagine asymptotic relationships.
 - Presume your own ignorance, and others' knowledgability.
 - Construct hierarchies of goals rather than win/lose dichotomies.
 - Resist institutional and cultural pressures promoting fear towards changing goals and environments.
 - Maintain multiple perspectives on as many things as possible.
 - Don't spend all your time doing meta-work; Do actual work.

## Advice on graduate programs from professors##
This is advice I actually have attributions for. Some of it is conflicting.

 - You will have less time in grad school than you think.
 - Have month, 6-month, year, and 5 year plans.
 - Recognize: papers are the only accepted currency in academia.
 - Non-first-author papers don't count for much.
 - Collaborations vary significantly in value. Think about their mechanics before committing.
 - Quality is far more important than volume, but there are minimum bars for volume too.
 - Specialization is what gets you a job, and why people will think of you.
 - Don't accidentally spend too little time on your thesis.
 - Feel free to do as you please and make up the narrative later.
 - Don't stop reading.
 - Read fewer things, but very, very carefully.
 - Graduate school is about building a foundation of knowledge.
 - Get obsessed with something.
 - Ignore failure.
 - Present your work often, at all stages.
 - Apply for funding early and often.
 - You cannot practice a talk too much.
 - Get feedback on your work from as many people as possible.
 - Practice writing as often as possible.

## My own suggestions regarding academia ##
Here are some observations and advice I would add regarding academia specifically. Just to be totally clear, they are comments tailored towards helping people overcome difficulties, and therefore may sound at first glance to be negative or critical of academia. Instead they are simply intended to be helpful. Often people are aware of all the great things about academia but, like many institutions, knowledge about negative expriences appears to become siloed by people's impressions that such experiences are not shared.

That said, people in academia may or may not generally expend effort to help you. In my ideal world, this would not be the case, but constraints and maybe more importantly, perceptions of constraints result in _highly_ varied support environments. This can occur because academics are extremely busy people, because they have different ideas about what results in intellectual and professional development than you may, because they have no idea what you need, no capacity or no motivation to provide it, different ideas about their roles with respect to you, or of course because the world has unexplainable phenomena in it.

My second point would be that academia appears to exhibit, like many systems, rich get richer dynamics; The more you speak up the more people will make note of you and the better a speaker you will become. The more practice you have already accrued in articulating complex ideas about topics you may not be familiar with, the more likely others are to believe you are competent/intelligent/interesting etc. This of course affords you more opportunity, in addition to an audience that will collaboratively listen rather than assume rough hewn thoughts reflect poor thinking.

On the more positive side of course, academia is full of people who know loads about interesting topics and exert huge amounts of effort to understand the most complex things around. These points, and those below, simply reflect the fact that most people who may be interested in this writing know this already. So, here is some additional concrete advice:

 - Think in terms of mentors, explicit strategies, and back-up plans.
 - Read [this report](http://ga.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wellbeingreport_2014.pdf) on graduate student well being.
 - Determine what you are willing and unwilling to sacrifice before becoming a graduate student.
 - Read some of the many good articles examining academia, such as [this](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/04/bad-job-market-phds/479205/) one on the job market, the Guardian's [section](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/series/academics-anonymous), the NSF's statistics, or [this](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-prestige-shapes-professoriate) report on academic hiring. It is possible that much of what is online may be skewed negative, but negative experiences undeniably abound. Clearly many such difficulties occur across institutions as well.
 - Think carefully about the non-academic job market and the skills you intend to acquire.
 - Be picky about potential advisors and departmental environments.
 - Ask people ahead of you about things.
 - Most people in academia constitute unreliable sources of information, because they are people.
 - Consider reading literature such as 'A PhD is Not Enough', 'Ms. Mentor's Impeccable Advice', 'The Professor Is In', or other more in-depth treatments. Experiences, beliefs, and outcomes vary widely, and basic familiarity with others' experiences is cheap.


## Regarding graduate admissions ##
Please take this with a huge grain of salt; It's what I gather, not what I know.

 - Grades are only useful absent better information.
 - Providing better information is actually the hard part anyway.
 - Better information often consists of research experience and well thought out research questions.
 - The GRE predicts basically nothing.
 - If one is working in a technical field, acing the math portion of the GRE is more or less required by competitive schools.
 - Similarly for non-technical fields and the non-quantitative portion.
 - The European model of masters-then-PhD appears increasingly common in the U.S. and to be valuable.
 - I have been told (by a professor) that professors tend to be very cautious; that you are an investment with an expected return.
 - Apply to many places, with concrete plans tailored to each.

## A word from my soapbox ##
In light of the notes above (and the approximately post-scarcity situation in much of the western world) I would add that listening to, being available for, and trying to help others are the only important things. Useful advice is advice which helps one do these things, in the short run or the long.
